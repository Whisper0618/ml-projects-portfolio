# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of machine learning projects covering supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning tasks. All projects were developed using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and scikit-learn. Each notebook demonstrates end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## Projects

### 1. Classification
A supervised learning task to classify structured data using multiple models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

 [`Classification_Final.ipynb`](classification/Classification_Final.ipynb)

---

### 2. Clustering
An unsupervised learning project to group patterns in data based on features. Applied to datasets like:
- Injury cases
- Cause of death
- Residence area

 [`Clustering_(Injury)_Final.ipynb`](clustering/Clustering_(Injury)_Final.ipynb)  
 [`Clustering_(Death)_Final.ipynb`](clustering/Clustering_(Death)_Final.ipynb)  
 [`Clustering_(Residence)_Final.ipynb`](clustering/Clustering_(Residence)_Final.ipynb)

---

### 3. Anomaly Detection
A semi-supervised task focused on identifying outliers using:
- Isolation Forest
- Feature scaling and visualization

 [`AnomalyDetection_Final.ipynb`](anomaly/AnomalyDetection_Final.ipynb)
